# 🏍️ MotoGP Results Manager

**MotoGP Results Manager** is an open data web application that began as a personal project to practice web development skills in different languages. Over time, it evolved into a fully-fledged platform with a main goal: to build a comprehensive and well-structured data hub for motorcycle racing competitions with a focus on:

> 📊 Easy access to structured data by rider, track, or constructor.
> 🔄 Updates every once in a while focused on adding more functionalities.
> 🛠️ Open for community contributions and suggestions, specially by its potential users and/or audience.

## 🌐 Technologies, languages and data sources

**MRM** information is based on a [KaggleHub dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alrizacelk/moto-gp-world-championship19492022) by **ALİ RIZA CELİK**. It is built using React + Vite for the front-end and Python + FastAPI for the back-end.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **ALİ RIZA CELİK**'s dataset contains static data, so, by consequence, the app shares its same potential limitations (like data being not updated to the current date and/or season, for example).
